# Freeks Corp Analysis
This is a python program that allows for the analysis of the performance of different digital marketing campaigns. It calculates metrics such as CPA, RPA, monthly profit, among others, and also simulates a crisis to indicate possible campaign optimizations. Based on the results of the analysis, it is possible to identify campaigns that need optimization to achieve a minimum ROI of 100% and which campaign should be paused in case of budget reduction. Additionally, the program suggests a strategy to achieve the company's minimum profit goal.

## Objective
The objective of the analysis is to evaluate the performance of digital marketing campaigns and identify possible optimizations to achieve a minimum ROI of 100%. It is also important to identify the campaign that should be paused in case of budget reduction and suggest a strategy to achieve the company's minimum profit goal.

## Conclusions
Based on the results of the analysis, it is concluded that campaigns C and D need optimization to achieve a minimum ROI of 100%. Additionally, campaign A should be paused in case of budget reduction, as it proportionally produces less, has lower CTR, and lower TX. To achieve the minimum profit goal, the suggestion is to invest in campaign B, as it has the highest TX and the highest potential for growth.

## Recommendations
1. Optimize the remaining campaigns (C and E) to further improve CPA and ROI, for example, by adjusting CPC (Cost per Click) bids to get more qualified clicks and increase conversion rate.
2. Invest in campaign B, as it has the highest TX and the highest potential for growth.
3. Considering that only 3 campaigns can run simultaneously, campaign A should be discontinued, as it proportionally produces less, has lower CTR, and lower TX.
4. Explore other online marketing opportunities, such as social media, email marketing, content marketing, SEO (Search Engine Optimization), and SEM (Search Engine Marketing), to diversify customer acquisition strategies and expand brand reach.
5. Invest in customer retention strategies, such as loyalty programs, exclusive promotions for repeat customers, and offer excellent after-sales service, to encourage repeat purchases and increase average transaction value.
6. Conduct market and competition analysis to identify niche opportunities, more precise segmentation, and differentiation from competitors, with the aim of attracting more qualified customers and increasing market share.
7. Monitor marketing campaign key performance indicators (KPIs) closely and make continuous adjustments to strategies based on results obtained, to ensure a data-driven approach and maximize return on investment.
8. These are some suggestions that can be considered to achieve the minimum goal of â‚¬500,000.00 per month.
A/B Testing: It is recommended to conduct A/B tests to identify which strategies and tactics are performing better. See below how to implement this tactic:
-------------------
| Indice | Exemplo |
| --- | --- |
| CPC | Create two versions of an ad, one with a higher CPC and another with a lower CPC, and expose each version to an equal part of the audience.      

Then, monitor performance metrics such as clicks, impressions, conversions, ROI, CPA, RPA, among others, and analyze the results to determine which variation achieved the best results.
